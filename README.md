Welcome to my GitHub. I am a front-end developer working primarily with Javascript and React.

Update: After completing my Teletherapy Library project, I took a personal break from coding to grieve the loss of my beloved canine buddy.
The computer chair feels empty without him, but his iggy spirit lives on. Currently, I'm diving into UI/UX design to better connect what 
I build with the people who use it. See you around the socials.
