Welcome to my GitHub. I am a front-end developer working primarily with Javascript and React.

Update: After completing my Teletherapy Library project, I took a personal break from coding to grieve the loss of my beloved canine buddy.
The computer chair feels empty without him, but his iggy spirit lives on. 🐾 Currently, I'm diving into UI/UX design to better connect what 
I build with the people who use it. See you around the socials.
